# **"Hello, World" for Hardware**

This repository contains examples that can be used when learning how to write
a simple application for a language, tool, platform, etc.

## **Description and Requirements**

All software related items were tested on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).

Some of the code can already run on the hardware directly without installing any additional software (i.e. the Python files in /boards/raspberry_pi/ for
controlling GPIO on Raspberry Pi boards).

Otherwise follow all dependencies are listed below.

### /acceleration/openCL/Intel

- (Intel) OpenCL

The examples are taken from or based on the following site:

### /acceleration/cuda_c

- (Nvidia) CUDA C

### /boards/intel_cyclone_10_lp_evaluation_kit

- Intel Quartus Prime

### /boards/raspberry_pi

The examples are taken from or based on the following site:
